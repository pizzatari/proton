Battle for Proton (Atari 2600)

This is a personal project under my copyright. No support provided. You may not distribute source or binaries. The source code is made public for review and archival reasons. 

Built within a Cygwin environment, but it should also build under any UNIX or Linux platform. Dasm and Perl must be compiled/installed separately and be in your PATH. It relies on atarilib existing in the parent directory (../atarilib/).
